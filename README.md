## Technology used

This template uses the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - scalable and high-performance **React.js** framework for modern web development. Provides a large set of features, such as hybrid rendering, route prefetching, automatic image optimization, and internationalization, out of the box.
- [Cosmic](https://www.cosmicjs.com/) - fast, fully managed [headless CMS](https://www.cosmicjs.com/headless-cms) that enables us to quickly manage and create website content including UGC (user-generated content).
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) - payments infrastructure that provides API tools to receive one-time and subscription payments.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cosmicjs/unft-marketplace.git
cd unft-marketplace
pnpm install
# or
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Environment variables

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project. Log in to [Cosmic](https://app.cosmicjs.com/) and from **Bucket Settings > API Access** get your API access keys. Then log in to [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) and get your keys in the **for developers** section. Add your keys to the `.env` file like so:

```bash
//.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_COSMIC_BUCKET_SLUG=your_cosmic_slug
NEXT_PUBLIC_COSMIC_READ_KEY=your_cosmic_read_key
COSMIC_WRITE_KEY=your_cosmic_write_key

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
```

## Then run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
